## complementary thing

- setup krakend api gateway
- clean up postman documentation
- add good readme repository documentation

## what's missing ? (reason: dont have free time to add it)

- better error handling
- query validation
- body json validation

## improvement that can be done

- user management feature, ex: forgot password, change password, advance permission etc.. (don't have much time to add this feature 🙏)
- add security package (hpp,helmet,csrf etc)
- can add better message broker for advance event manager, ex: kafka
- if still wanna using redis stream, please setup consumer group to each services for better load balancing
- setup better event data store scenario, ex: if more than 90 days, store event to file not just in memory
- write unit & integration test
- add docker & kubernetes (if you have a lot of free time 🤣)
